 Eclipse is a widely used Integrated Development Environment among JAVA developers.
In addition to JAVA, this IDE supports additional languages, such as C, C++, and 
Python. This free and open-source IDE uses a modern interface and is available 
for multiple operating systems. Eclipse is popular among developers because of 
its numerous features like syntax highlighting, code completion, code refactoring,
debugging, and unit testing. When choosing an IDE, I did consider using this one.
However, I decided to use jGrasp instead. I avoided using Eclipse for multiplreasons. Mainly, I have previous experience with jGrasp and am confident in 
operating it. In researching various forums, I found that many users believe 
Eclipse could be more user-friendly and tend to have multiple bugs. When deciding,
I chose not to use Eclipse due to the reviews of other users and my comfortability
with other IDEs.
