For this class I decided to use jGrasp as an Integrated Development Environment. I
spent a lot of time deliberating on which IDE to use. I researched multiple
options and found a lot of pros and cons for a lot of different IDEs. jGrasp is
typically described as a user-friendly, easy-to-learn software. The fact that
jGrasp is commonly used in education environments swayed my decision. This IDE
provides syntax highlighting, code navigation, and UML visualization capabilities.
Ultimately, I chose this IDE because I believe using it will give me a solid
foundation in the fundamentals of using IDEs.
